# Environment and required tools

## Laravel Herd

Install Laravel Herd. Open PowerShell and verify versions for php, composer and nodejs with:

```shell
php -v
composer --version
node --version
```

If no _node_ version is showing, use the command:

```shell
# replace x.x.x with whatever version you have installed
nvm use x.x.x
```

You can use the _nvm_ command to manage the versions for node.

## PowerShell

Check the current version by typing the following command on a powershell window:

```shell
$PSVersionTable
```
